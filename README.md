# Mad-Libs
I've made a game called Mad-Libs using using and the module tkinter
I never used tkinter so I copied of someone on how to use it. More or less copied his entire piece of code for the tkinter module.
The rest was pretty easy the only thing left to do was make bunch of input() and combine everything with print.
I couldve made it more elegant using an F-string instead of concatenating everything which seperate strings but Im happy with my code nonetheless.
